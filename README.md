# Scientific-Calculator
The scientific calculator project using Python is a graphical user interface (GUI) application developed with PyQt5, a Python library for creating desktop applications. The calculator integrates with Python's math library for advanced mathematical computations which include the use of exponents, square root, logarithmic functions, trigonometric functions, and fundamental arithmetic operations.
The key components and features of the scientific calculator project are briefly described as follows:
1. Designing a GUI with PyQt5:

  The PyQt5 library is used in the design of the graphical user interface, which offers a visually pleasing and simple calculator layout.
	QPushButton widgets are used to implement buttons for numbers, arithmetic operations, trigonometric functions, and other mathematical operations.

2. Functionality:

  Basic mathematical operations including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division are supported by the calculator.
  Trigonometric functions (sin, cos, tan), square root (√), exponentiation (xⁿ), logarithmic functions (log, ln), and factorial are included to perform more complex computations in mathematics.
  Included are special constants like π (pi) and the mathematical constant 'e'.

3. Percentage Calculation:

  Users may rapidly calculate percentages of numbers with the calculator's support for percentage calculations.

4. Scientific Functions:

  To enhance a calculator's performance, scientific functions like cube (x³), square (x²), and cube root are implemented.

5. Integration with math module:

   To analyze mathematical expressions that require trigonometric functions, logarithms, square roots, and other complex operations, use Python's math module.

This scientific calculator project is suitable for both simple and complex calculations because it offers a wide range of functionality. It's a helpful tool for users in science, engineering, mathematics, and other professions because of its sophisticated mathematical capabilities combined with a well-designed graphical user interface.
